            <div></div>
            <div className="center">
            <p><i>The Migration Issue will focus on exploring the themes of immigration/emigration, borders, diaspora, and nationhood. Through art, fiction, poetry, and personal essays, the Migration Issue will address these themes as they apply to broad and particular experiences. The issue will include voices from both the Harvard and non-Harvard community, with the goal of a sustained dialogue around these topics and what they mean. This project ultimately seeks to build community and mutual understanding through creative power, and to uplift the experiences and expressions of those who connected to migration--however people may interpret this word. In addition to the publication itself, the project will also include panels, discussions, and workshops. The Migration Issue is produced in collaboration with Palabritas, Act on a Dream, Stories from the Border, and Harvard Scholars at Risk.</i></p>
