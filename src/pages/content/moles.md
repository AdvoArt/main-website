moles just want

 to have fun can't

 wait to see the sun

 explode in their

 star-shaped eyes

 struck like the

 child looking in

 eyes on the prize:

 the mole

 a peripatetic

 of a whole

 network of moles

 not quite like

 a society of children

 in the vicinity of the sun: who

 can't wait to have fun

 in their hole-shaped eyes

 the things they would have found

 are not afraid

 of the sun.Â
