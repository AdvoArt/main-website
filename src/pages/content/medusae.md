underwater they are terribly  
farsighted, your body blurs  
  


 as you approach. their bodies  
are set elsewhere. heavy  
  


 chandeliers sinking  
with chains braided by wax,  
  


 tempting you to reach into  
their folds and search them  
  


 for whatever you threw  
into the murky sea,  
  


 see if they would spill out  
or harden like shells.  
  


 you peel one, look for the heart,  
highly organized water,   
  


 it is shaking. you find a stone,   
apply pressure, watch it shatter.
