in the kingdom of purity i obeyed my husband  
i walked behind him my breasts covered  

by a camera     in his arms was a mirror held aloft  
i faced myself & myself blurred in slightest motion  

light fleeing the shutter      & in the castle of purity  
i closed the lights & faced my husband & my husband  

called me by my glottal name      my mouth  
a depression in clay      my mouth a mirror in the arms  

of my husband       my minaret a nipple in the direction  
of my husband & five times a day i hesitate      & five  

times a day i chip a tooth & study sepia photographs  
to learn names for my mothers    to learn arrangements  

for my photographed parts    my captured parts  
i tighten the frame      i close my legs  

when i say girlhood i say prison  
i clean myself up & repent
