water hangs low,  
rarely falls.  
here, our trees and hands  
fall victim to it,  
vouchsafed by it.  
victims, because it erases  
cicadas’ footprints  
and the army ants’ prey.  
peculiar though, this erasure—  
with wider aperture  
humidity lifts and stays,  
footprints are removed  
and yet remain overhead  
in extended exposure.  
a suspension—  
retaining multitudes  
that ought to slide  
like moments off the hands  
you live through.  
seize this history  
in salt and landscape’s  
italic interstice: hold.
