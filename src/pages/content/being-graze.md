 evaporative forces and their

 inverses brawl with

 good nature—sitting idly

 watching my own

 humidity, sloughed and bunched

 back furtively like clumps of wool.

  

 blessing self for loving

 shears—when my ears were

 clipped, the dryness of the air

 ate closer towards my eyes.

  

 my muteness divulged by the rain,

 roaring down through

 capillaries hung limp from

 the woolen clouds. not all

 visual constructions are waterproof.

 the channels quicken narrow, still.
