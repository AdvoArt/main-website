Spring at the Advocate is a time for leaving.  
School wanes, days get hotter. People trickle  
out of Cambridge in ones and twos and then all  
at once. Cardboard boxes pile up on the sides  
of streets, lled with the expendable matter of  
college life: textbooks and miniature trash bins,  
cheap desk lamps and plastic shelves. Students  
haul them into basements, stack them up in  
identical rows, and let them sit for a while, as  
they coat with dust and suffuse with the smell  
of peat. Then, at a certain point in May, casual

 goodbyes gain weight. As our friends say good-  
bye for the last time in a while, “see you soon,”

 we respond, not knowing if we will.

  

 We’ve always found it uncanny and sad  
that a mass of people can disperse so seamlessly,  
like fog in sunlight. Your social life warps and  
shrinks as the people you run into every day  
become elsewhere. But the Spring issue comes

 to you from this nonspace; our writers and art-  
ists bring you with them as they go home, here,

 and away. Fittingly, these pages present visions  
of worlds in constant transit: mighty kingdoms  
dissipate into playgrounds, geological history is  
reverse-engineered, empress dowagers are wiped  
from the record-books, and the distant past grows  
tentacles to come knocking on our collective  
front doors.

  

 Open it up and let it take you there.
