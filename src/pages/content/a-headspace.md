“Let’s use media to trespass on the divide between self and other. How can you make a body into a virtual  
prosthesis able to calibrate, reconfigure, and displace the semi-permeable boundary between here and  
there? If you try, you can form a mutually-fulfilling relationship with such an avatar. Can we reincarnate  
ourselves in a way that blurs the line between you and me?

   
This body of work is dedicated to a piece of chromakey green fabric in my studio that constitutes an  
interstice between the actual and the virtual. Over the course of this project, it was repeatedly subjected to  
digital erasure in order to give these incarnations virtual homes.”
