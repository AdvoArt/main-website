I don’t believe in reincarnation categorically, although I don’t want to consider death as an absolute end or entirely close off the possibility of reincarnation. For a long time in Eastern philosophy, death was not considered as being separate from life. But much of Korean society has become westernized, and many consider death to be directly opposed to life. Countless people die from wars, accidents, and crimes throughout the world. But these days we encounter so many dead people who could not die properly because they were not properly commemorated, or people whose bodies are alive but spirits are dead. The Sewol ferry incident that took place in South Korea about a year ago speaks to this situation. Pain slowly reappears when we try to escape from memory and oblivion. Rein- carnation does not seek to signify the emergence of an unprecedented phenomenon, but suggests a way of remem- bering the deceased and the suffering, as well as restoring conscience, morality, and empathy. It’s also a title that reflects my personal exploration, that which deals with the meaning of my life at the present moment and explores means of sharing pain with others.
