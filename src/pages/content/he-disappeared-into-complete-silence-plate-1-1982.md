EXCERPTED FROM 1982 SUMMER ISSUE

  

 Plate 1

     Once there was a girl and she loved a man. 

     They had a date next to the eighth street station of the sixth

 avenue subway. 

     She had put on her good clothes and a new hat. Somehow he could not come. So the purpose of this pictures is to show how         beautiful she was. I really mean that she was beautiful.
