That’s what the leaves are telling us tonight.  
Hear them panic and then fall silent,  
So though we strain our ears, we hear nothing—  
Which is far more terrifying than something.

   
Minutes seem to pass, whole lifetimes,  
While we wait for it to show itself  
This very moment, or maybe the next?  
As the trees rush to make us believe

   
Their branches banging on the house  
To be let in and then reconsidering.  
All those millions of leaves suddenly quiet  
As if not wishing to add to our terror,

   
With something evil lurking out there,  
And drawing closer and closer to us.  
The house dark and quiet as a mouse,  
If one had been brave to stick around.
