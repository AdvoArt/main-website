L: Four times a year, our printer deposits a mountain of

 boxes in our front hall. We pull off the tape to get our hands

 on the new issues, our glossy seasonal produce. Upstairs the

 magazines are variously pored over, flipped through, tossed

 on the ground, stacked on the tables, organized

 chronologically one day and repurposed as coasters the

 next. Every other cover bears a sticky purple ring of dried

 wine like a bruise. Some of the boxes don’t get opened.

 These migrate into a particular closet, and then, after a

 decade, to a second closet across the hall, and then, at

 twenty years of age, to the sad cement nook beneath the

 basement stairs. Down there, dust and water form a paste

 that glues the issues’ pages together. The ones that survive

 stick around for a while: the rough paper of the early

 Advocate’s pamphlets cohabitates in our bookshelves with

 the smooth prismatic matte of the past decade. Our first

 fifty volumes have retired to bound tomes. When we poke

 through copies from the 90s, we imagine our predecessors

 lounging around these very couches while we––the future

 so-called collegiate literati––were napping in our baby

 strollers. This fall, we’ve resurrected the glossy vibes of the

 70s Advocate. Paper: slick. Spine: stapled. Content? Fresh.

 L: A naturalization of the eerie, or exposing of the sinister?

 A fall from grace, or a courageous leap? Was it said, or was

 it embodied? Cyclical motion, or an arrest of momentum?

 New England autumn points ambiguously to mortality and

 vigor in the face of it, toward the moral and the sensorial,

 forward and backwards. In this issue, the light and dark

 consider their changing relationship. The retrospective

 is constructed, and the new smiles back uncannily. And

 featured contributors Sarah Nicholson and Jorge Olivera

 Castillo publish work, for which we are extremely grateful.
