The sunset-red boy in his little canoe

 can only cast his line out so far

  

 as his father stands grimacing

 on an opposite island: an aging man 

  

 in Crete who spat at me once, 

 then peered into his little salty pool

  

 with contempt that I turned my head away from—

 if only to find the next blind peasant

  

 lonely with his stories of St. Anthony

  

 (he overheard them from the nuns

 who passed through the island like clouds last July) 

  

 and his open palms, expecting me 

  

 to hand him the visible sun 

 like a hot coin from his youth

  

 spent wandering into and out of cathedrals

 and brothels, not understanding 

  

 the tombs he was kissing

 or the marble faces

  

 that watched him pleasantly 

 in his boyhood sleep,

  

 humming quietly to themselves 

 about the price of light in the current market,

  

 where the man who sells grapes 

 charges one-euro-eighty for every basket

  

 and leaves their seeds to float in the sea

 like miniature boats towards Alexandria.
