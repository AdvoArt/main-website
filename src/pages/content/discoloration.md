as if eaten away 

 beyond the storm

  

 overwhelmingly

 searing colors

  

 beating back clouds 

 fixed by light

  

 cleaning wounds 

 stroke deeply & clear

  

 eddy of dark water 

 today with cancer

the shroud lifts 

 menacing brush

  

 here a guest 

 the season ends

  

 pulled out of sight 

 uncharacteristic

  

 in water, silhouettes 

 (tears, shriek, hush)

  

 uncomposed

 it doesn’t affect you

a canvas corner 

 strokes against realism

  

 appearance of blood 

 that swan in the sky

  

 a pupil’s bridges 

 turning in wind

  

 raise their oars 

 a thick cocktail

  

 scans came back 

 you unravel
