  Not a solid thing, like steel or a rock.

 Full of voids, the way a vault is capacity

 for what is to come, and what was.

 The passing of a person who has built it.

  

 In this way it resembles bone—serpent

 eating its tail, one half, osteoclast,

 dissolving the other, cells foaming

 from this effort. Bone-cleaver cleaved

  

 to bone. Though what survives is just the distal

 white form, a hollow—bone’s death

 masks—what awe that we make out

 of this brokenness a constellation: bone.
